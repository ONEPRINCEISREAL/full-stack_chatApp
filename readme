Deployment of a Full-stack Real-time Chat Application on Kubernetes Successfully

I have recently completed the deployment of a full-stack real-time chat application (react front-end and node.js back-end, MongoDB Database) on kubernetes as containerized microservices with full orchestration of kubernetes for the entire application stack.

What I Built:

I wrote and created all of the kubernetes configurations manually for all aspects of the application, including:

Deployment Manifests

Service Definitions

Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim for MongoDB

Secret and Config Map

Namespace Separation

Architecture Ready for Ingress and Production Scalability

By interacting with YAML directly for each aspect of the Application, I have been able to gain an in-depth and practical understanding of the various concepts of kubernetes.

The Key Challenge and My Solution:
1. MongoDB Connectivity Issues

The backend could not connect to mongoDB which produced the following errors: ‘ECONNREFUSED :27017’ and authentication errors.

My Solution:

Corrected the selector of MongoDB service

Patched the service to connect to the correct pod

Verified the connection to mongoDB from within a test pod by running mongosh

Fixed the setup of Secrets that were injected into the backend

2. Backend CrashLoopBackOff

The backend was crashing over and over due to a ‘MongoServerSelectionError’ and due to environmental variables not being set.

My Solution:

Fixed the Database URI

Verified the ConfigMap and Secret injection

Restarted the Deployment and confirmed in real-time logs

3. Frontend Cannot Reach Backend

The frontend was returning Internal Server Errors when attempting to connect to the backend.

Solution:

Exposed the backend using the correct ClusterIP Service

Added environment variables to the frontend

Correctly port-forwarded for local access during testing

4. JWT Secret Misconfiguration

The backend showed: secretOrPrivateKey should not be empty

Solution:

Added the required JWT secret as a Kubernetes Secret

Mounted and verified the value in the backend pods

Re-deployed the backend

5. Port-Forwarding and Service Port Issues

Initial attempts at port forwarding yielded: Service does not have a service port 3000

Solution:

The correct service ports were checked

8080:80 forwarded for frontend

5001:5001 forwarded for the backend

Ensured repeatable background port-forwarding setups

Final Outcome

The backend service is up and connected with MongoDB

MongoDB is running with persistent storage and authenticated access

The frontend is fully functional and communicates with the backend

The entire application runs inside Kubernetes, and all components are correctly orchestrated
